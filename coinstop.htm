  <h1>CoinStop</h1>
  <h3>You’re on the subway after work and you want dessert. Do you have time to search for ice cream parlors at each stop? Our API minimizes your search by finding all nearest ones along your subway route.</h3>
  <div>CoinStop was created by <a href="https://www.postman.com/coolcats123">teamBoLD</a> (Brian Dinh, Lydia Choi and Derek Jamison) for <a href="https://postman-hack.devpost.com/">The Postman API Hack Jan 5-25, 20201</a> (although we formed our team on Jan 10 and came up with the core idea of implementing CoinStop on Jan 12.)</div>

  <div>Resources:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://jamisonderek.github.io/coinstop.htm">https://jamisonderek.github.io/coinstop.htm</a> contains all the resources about the project.</li>
    <li><a href="https://tinyurl.com/coinstop">Our DEVPOST Entry</a> (<a href="https://devpost.com/software/yelp-subway-placeholder-name-insert-something-cool-later">backup link</a>)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/coolcats123/workspace/coinstop/overview">Our Postman workspace</a> (you can also find it by <a href="https://www.postman.com/explore">searching Postman</a> for <b>CoinStop</b>)</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/jamisonderek/jamisonderek.github.io">Web site resources</a> for JavaScript (used by Visualize tab), assets (like our coin images), and this documentation.  We originally were using the mock responses feature, but we used up our 1,000 calls/month on the free plan.</li>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/gLEb1pqISwI">YouTube</a> video hosting for showing the Postman workspace in details.</a>
  </ul>

  <div>If the project name is "CoinStop" why are a few things named "coin-stops"?  The reason is that late in the cycle we found out that <a href="https://coinstop.io">coinstop.io</a> is a company is Australia’s leading and most trusted cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider.  So while we are a totally different project, we accidently used a similar name (except our "S" is capitalized.)
We started renaming things to try to avoid using CoinStop in the name, but videos were already created, etc.  Luckily one of the lifelong friends of the Co-Founder of Coinstop, Chirs Pavlesic (who is also on Team coinstop.io), gave us permission for the hackathon to use the project name "CoinStop" & wished us "Good luck with your hackathon project!"  So at some point "CoinStop" will 
become "CoinStops" but today is not that day.</div>
  <p></p>
  <div>Future Ideas:
    <ul>
    <li>Rename the project from "CoinStop" to "CoinStops" (so if you can't find us at CoinStop anymore, be sure to check for CoinStops).  If that doesn't work, <a href="mailto:teamBoLD@jamisoncreations.com">reach out</a> to us on email!</li>
    <li>Adding Twitter integration; we have ideas on how we want it to work.</li>
    <li>More refactoring & adding tests.</li>
    <li>Host CoinStop on a web site, using Newman or <a href="https://tinyurl.com/CloudNewman">CloudNewman</a></li>
    <li>Use <a href="https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/sms/">Vonage SMS</a> to allow specifying the Start;End;BusinessType/Name;Radius and get back the DropBox link we are already creating.</li>
    <li>Account for other modes of transportation besides subways (Cars, buses, etc).</li>
    <li>Scale up.</li>
