<h1>CoinStop</h1>
<div>Youâ€™re on the subway after work and you want dessert. Do you have time to search for ice cream parlors at each stop? Our API minimizes your search by finding all nearest ones along your subway route.</div>
<div>CoinStop was created by teamBoLD (Brian Dinh, Lydia Choi and Derek Jamison) for The Postman API Hack Jan 5-25, 20201 (although we formed our team on Jan 10 and came up with the core idea of implementing CoinStop on Jan 12.)</div>
